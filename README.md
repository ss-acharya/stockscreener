# stockscreener

These scripts take in earnings data (of many companies) in the form of .csv files along with the tickers and outputs (for each company) a bar graph comparing earnings and revenue. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Background

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

When trying to understand how well a company does, the first thing that an investor looks at is the stock price. Stock price is a convenient thing to look at on a site at a brockerage because it is given and it is daily. However, it is a highly volatile parameter to work with. Therefore, if possible, we work with earnings.

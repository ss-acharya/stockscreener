# stockscreener

These scripts take in earnings data (of many companies) in the form of .csv files along with the tickers and outputs (for each company) a bar graph comparing earnings and revenue. 

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Background

Use this space to show useful examples of how a project can be used. Additional screenshots, code examples and demos work well in this space. You may also link to more resources.

When trying to understand how well a company does, the first thing that an investor looks at is the stock price. Stock price is a convenient thing to look at on a site at a brockerage because it is given and it is daily. However, it is a highly volatile parameter to work with. Therefore, if possible, we work with yearly company earnings to try and understand how well a company does. 


<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Problem / Question

We want to understand how well a company performs in the long-term, not just the short-term that stock price gives us. As such, we take earnings data and use that to create quick and simple reports for options traders, stock traders and whoever decides to work this. This way, a trader can make decisions in real time. 


<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Methods

The method for this was that I used the language R to write the scripts that take the data in so as to start the report creation. I also use the package flextable (in R) as well as R programming so as to create the best of processing to data for reporting and outputting at as a functional report.
